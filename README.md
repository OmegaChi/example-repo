-Repo is short for repository, it's a place to story your code
-Cloning is the action of copying a repo to your computer device
-The difference between staging and commiting is that staging sets up files to be committed while committing is the process where we take the staged files and slap a "this is done" label on it before sending it to GitHub
-Pushing is the final act of sending the files from your computer to GitHub
